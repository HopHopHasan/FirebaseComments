# FirebaseComments
The comment section system used on the HopHopHasan sites!

This demonstrates an example of a comment section you can use on a website, through Google Firebase!

Once you've deployed the Firebase site, embed the comment site in an iframe, where ?page= is the "group" you want to read and write to.

```
https://examplesitecomments.firebaseapp.com/?page=commentSection
```

The comment box will embed seamlessly into the inital site.
