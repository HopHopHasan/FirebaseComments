# FirebaseComments
The comment section system used on the HopHopHasan sites!

This demonstrates an example of a comment section you can use on a website, through Google Firebase!

Once you've deployed the Firebase site, embed the comment site in an iframe, where ?page= is the "group" you want to read and write to.
